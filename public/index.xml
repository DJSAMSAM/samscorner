      <description>Tl;dr We went to bosnia here´s a VIDEO of it.&#xA;In the fall of 2024, me and my partner were faced with a new and unfamiliar predicament. Not only were we part of the socio-economic group some people call D.I.N.K´s, my partner was also enjoying her first höstlov(fall holiday week) as a teacher. This needed an appropriate celebration, dog days were over and we were ready for the high life! We decided that a short vacation would be fitting.</description>

      <description>Motorcycles. They are unnecessary, obnoxious, dangerous and anti-social. Despite all this(or maybe because of it?), many men build their identities around these mid life crisis machines.&#xA;In the spring of 2024, having worked a few months as a grunt at a Slovenian tech company, I could for the first time in my life seriously consider buying a motorcycle. One weekend, a deal that I could not resist popped up: A newly serviced and inspected Suzuki GS500E for 14 000 SEK(~1300$).</description>

      <description>It´s about time this page gets launched. It´s been in the back of my head for a long time. Ever since I started watching this slightly alt-right feeling guy Luke Smith, I knew I needed my own website.&#xA;It became even more apparent when I, as I often do when my mental health is good, was rambling about something that I had researched to my girlfriend. After maybe half an hour of elaborate comparisons of motorcycle engine layouts, or the virtues of different sailboat rig types, or some other nonsense occupying 95% of my cognitive abilities, she turned to me(probably in despair), and said:</description>

      <description>As you can see I have no comments on my website. This is mostly because it´s a minor PITA to implement. If you want to get in touch, contact me on my slightly obfuscated email below:&#xA;samuel&amp;quot;letter R&amp;quot;w99@gmail.com</description>

      <description>My own corner of the internet &amp;ldquo;A static website in 2024?&amp;rdquo; That´s right, we´re going old school here!&#xA;The internet is constantly evolving, and for the last 10 years, it hasn´t been for the better. Nowadays our internet is flooded with AI-generated search engine optimized pages, bots and algorithms that decide what content and ads you are supposed to watch. Dead internet theory feels more real than ever.&#xA;As an attempt to regain control, and to have a place in this vast landscape to call my own, I created this website.</description>
