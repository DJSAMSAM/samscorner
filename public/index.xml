      <description>Look mom, I´m on the Internet! It´s about time this page gets launched. It´s been in the back of my head for a long time. Ever since I started watching this slightly alt-right feeling guy Luke Smith, I knew I needed my own website.&#xA;It became even more apparent when I, as I often do when my mental health is good, was rambling about something that I had researched to my girlfriend.</description>

      <description>As you can see I have no comments on my website. This is mostly because it´s a minor PITA to implement. If you want to get in touch, contact me on my slightly obfuscated email below:&#xA;samuel&amp;quot;letter R&amp;quot;w99@gmail.com</description>

      <description>My own corner of the internet &amp;ldquo;A static website in 2024?&amp;rdquo; That´s right, we´re going old school here!&#xA;The internet is constantly evolving, and for the last 10 years, it hasn´t been for the better. Nowadays our internet is flooded with AI-generated search engine optimized pages, bots and algorithms that decide what content and ads you are supposed to watch. Dead internet theory feels more real than ever.&#xA;As an attempt to regain control, and to have a place in this vast landscape to call my own, I created this website.</description>
