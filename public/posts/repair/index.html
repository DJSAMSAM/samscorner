<h1>Build and repair your own stuff</h1>
<p><strong>Oh the dreadful menial tasks of life. Vacuuming, cooking, doing the dishes, all to end up with a dirty apartment,
smudgy dishes and an empty stomach only a few hours later. If I were more of hobby-psychologist, I would make
a comparison to Sisyphus, but I am so tired of everyone and their grandma talking about him, so I wont.
Besides, it´s in the core nature of cell-based life to always struggle against entropy, get over it. Oh you read
about Sisyphus? Wait until you hear about Na+/K+-ATPase or Cythochrome C..</strong></p>
<p>In our post industrial society, we are moving towards outsourcing as much as possible of the dull chores of the past.
This is in many ways a good thing, we don´t want to be stuck washing our clothes in the river, farming our own miserable
beetroots and weaving fabrics from whatever fibrous material we can find. However, I can sometimes feel a lack of control
when the only level of self sufficiency we are expected to have is to go to work, earn as many <em>digital moneys</em> as possible,
so that we can pay other people to do everything else in our lives. If you are like me, and feel you want more self sufficiency
than this, I will list some of the things one can do to feel more in control!</p>
