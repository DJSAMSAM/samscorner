<h1>How // Why should I document my life?</h1>
<p><strong>Journaling, mindfulness, mood scarves, photo albums, digital picture frames, gratefulness jars etc. The ways that we can store information about ousersevles today are seemingly endless. As I´m writing this in early january of 2025, I should really be tending to my &ldquo;yearly archiving&rdquo;. But as always when there are many ways to do something, I start to doubt if my way of doing it is right. So, to find a better way to go about things, or at least to alleviate my doubts about my system for now, I think we need to look more closely at the matter.</strong></p>
<h3 id="500-images-per-day">500 images per day</h3>
<p>It is cliché to say that a picture says more than a than a thousand words, but images are a good place to start when discussing what we should add to life´s filing cabinet. The question is, how many do we need, and what should they be of?</p>
<p>Looking into the classic family photo albums of say 20-25 years ago, we see pictures of the exceptional times. Baby´s first bath, birthdays, vacations, new car purchases etc. This makes sense, most people didn´t carry a camera full time, especially during the film era where there only were a handful 35mm cameras that were truly pocketable. Images also cost multiple orders of magnitude more to take and develop back then, so taking pictures of mundane or less interesting things to many must have felt wasteful.</p>
<p>Looking at the above statement, one could argue that this paints an incomplete, bordering on dishonest picture of life. I know that I used to think that way as a teenager. In a way, we are much better at capturing our &ldquo;real&rdquo; lives compared to the film camera days, now that we carry smartphones with 3+ cameras around us everywhere, carelessly snapping pictures of timetables, wardrobe tags, part numbers etc.</p>
<p>The problem with comparing our newer, less focused imaging habits, with our more restrained photography habits of yesterdecade, is that the perceived value of images seem to follow that of wine. The values increase with age, rarity and with whether they come from southern France or not. Of course it is therefore hard to compare the value of your 200+ bathroom selfies from yesterday to a dozen 30 year old pictures from a summer vacation in <em>Cap d´Agde</em>. The value of documenting a &ldquo;truer&rdquo; version of our lives will be discussed in the following sections, but personally I have never felt that our family photo albums were too short, and yet they only contain maybe 2-3</p>
