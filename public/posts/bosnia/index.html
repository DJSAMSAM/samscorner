<h1>The beautiful country with the horrific history</h1>
<p><strong>Tl;dr We went to bosnia here´s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwAZ1R2wLP0">VIDEO</a>of it.</strong></p>
<p>In the fall of 2024, me and my partner were faced with a new and unfamiliar predicament. Not only were we part of the socio-economic group some people  call <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=D.I.N.K">D.I.N.K´s</a>, my partner was also enjoying her first <strong>höstlov</strong>(fall holiday week) as a teacher. This needed an appropriate celebration, dog days were over and we were ready for the high life! We decided that a short vacation would be fitting.</p>
<p>With our history of poorly planned, physically tiring, economically challenged journeys across europe by land and sea, we had some compromises that we were not willing to make. The flight should be from our home town of Gothenburg, be shorter than 4 hours, with no layovers, and take us to a country with a pleasant climate. It should also be reasonably priced. The list of possible destinations went from seemingly infinite to very brief as we entered our criteria into the booking site´s search engine. In the end, it was almost as if the booking site defiantly replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Oh so you think you can come to me, at the last second, and be so peculiar about your flight? Alright, have it your way, you´re going to Bosnia.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the joke´s on them(and my poor girlfriend), because I love the Balkans. So off to Sarajevo we went!</p>

<p>It is almost embarrassing to admit how little I knew about Bosnia going into this trip. Maybe I can blame my old history teachers, who only taught us about Mesopotamia and a long lineage of Swedish kings all named Karl, leaving most of the incredibly turbulent 20th century out completely, but my &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; of Bosnia was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch duke Franz Ferdinand was shot here</li>
<li>They had some type of war in the 90´s</li>
<li>They love turbo diesel engines and eat only minced meat?</li>
</ul>
