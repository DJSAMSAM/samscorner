<h1>Petty revenge, activism or plain old frugality? Your vote counts!</h1>
<p>So&hellip; democracy and global politics have not been looking to good recently has it? A decade of far right populist parties gaining serious traction in various European countries. Colonial Emerald Boy and wrinkly old Mr Artificial <em>Ikterus</em> turning the largest western democracy into a non constitutional playhouse for 19 year old self proclaimed &ldquo;Big Balls&rdquo; incels. A bald bookstore magnate and an allegedly non-reptilian social media emperor are trading blows to see who can hoard the most wealth, while trying their bests to maintain their <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FWB">FWB</a>-relationsships with aforementioned Mr Apartheid and the second coming of the Annoying Orange.</p>
<p>A video recently popped up in my Youtube-feed, mentioning how a person has to choose whether the universe should be considered good or bad, and how choosing to see the universe as a good is essential to good mental health and a positive outlook on life. Of course I wish that my own outlook on life and the world around us was on the positive side of the spectrum, however, the previous paragraph suggests the opposite.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-suggest-you-do-no-matter-your-outlook-on-life">What I suggest you do, no matter your outlook on life:</h2>
<p>Having established, with my pessimistic (and hopefully somewaht entertaining) name-calling, that our global economy and political scene is not doing very good at the time, I would like to discuss what can be done about it.</p>
<p>When it comes to the political side, I suggest we do our best to keep our wits about us. We live in a time with unmatched access to information. But with our limited time, this is also a time where the battle for our attention has reached never before seen levels. Terrifying flashes, algorithm-curated feeds and sexualized advertisments all do their best to gain a foothold in minds.</p>
<p>Of course, I do not suggest that we isolate our selves from the internet and media, or impose censorship on the internet or media. The vast amount of knowledge, community and diversity that is readily available through the internet is something I beleive should be treasured and seen as one of the great accomplishments of our time. This enormous free flow of information is however not a <em>Katana</em>. As many things, it is a double edged sword. Free information flow is not an automatic, self regulating system that will reach.</p>
<p>In his recent book <em>Nexus</em>, Youval Noah Harrari challenges the view that more open communcation automatically leads to truth and reason, a view shared by many today including a ceratin gemstone funded tech charlatan, who beleives that with free access to information and using his truth AI, he can reach the uiltimate truths of our universe. Harrari presents the example of the printing press, an invention often descibed as having a key role in scientific enlightenment and the ending of the so called dark ages brought upon Europe by the catholic church. He counters this slightly naive view by describing the consequences of one of the first best selling printed works, which is not <em>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</em> by Copernicus, which could barely sell the 400 copies of its first edition. One of history´s first best sellers was instead <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> (eng. The Hammer of Witches) by Heinrich Kramer.</p>
<p>So, the story of our mate Heinrich goes like this: In a time where there is no real homogenous view of witches in Europe, with some cultures beleiveing in withes being good or even male, Kramer develops a weird obsession with these mythical beings, conducting a series of investigations and subsequent trials. His methods, often cruel and with very sexually explicit details being mentioned in his accusation, he gets the attention of Bishop Georg Golser, who eventually bans him from pursuing witches in Insbruck, and forcing him to reurn to Cologne. Out of pure spite, and to share his view on witches, he proceeds to publish the The Hammer of a witches, which becomes an instant success, being printed in millions of copies over dozens of editions all over europe. So why did Kramers vengeful delirium detailing the nature of witches do so well, when Copernicus work did so poorly.</p>
<p>Well, of course there is room for speculation here, but where Copernicus work did its best in describing the trajectories of celestial bodies, the themes of <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> hit a lot closer to our evolutionary weak spots. Kramers detailed desciption of witch orgies, combined with scenes of witches feasting on infants, caters parts of our nature that served us well throughout the more primitive part of our history, such as sexual obsession, xenophobia, disgust and terror. This might have served the hunter gatherer well, ensuring we make sure to reproduce even in times of misery, bash members of enemy tribes in the head, and remain cautious of danger and unfamiliar behaviours. In a more civilized society, much of these instincts are made redundant by diplomacy, support networks etc, even if they still seem to reside in our subconscious.</p>

<p>Should blame be put on the 15th century people falling for this kind of &ldquo;cheap trick&rdquo;-media? Maybe. But over 5 centuries later, we should <strong>absolutely</strong> not be falling for that nonsense anymore. I call it cheap trick because I genuinely beleive that using fear, xenophobia or sex to sell or push an agenda is used when someone has nothing of value and need to circumvent reason by taking a cheap shot at slicing our Achilles heel.</p>
<p>This is probably the reason why populism and rampant consumtion is so prominent. Not because there are suddenly are so incredibly many good products to buy, but because we are at the mercy of politicians and advertisers using our instincts against us, leaving little room for reason. But we can do better. With a conscious knowledge of the tricks used against us, we should be able to discern between cheap shots at our nature and real policies driving us forwards. As beings that are more than our head-bashing Neanderthal ancestors, we can vote in a way that says: <strong>&ldquo;I see you, I see what you are trying to do, and I will not fall for it!&rdquo;</strong></p>
