### My own corner of the internet ###
"A static website in 2024?" That´s right, we´re going old school here!

The internet is constantly evolving, and for the last 10 years, it hasn´t been for the better.
Nowadays our internet is flooded with AI-generated search engine optimized pages, bots
and algorithms that decide what content and ads you are supposed to watch.
[Dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) feels more real than ever.

As an attempt to regain control, and to have a place in this vast landscape to call my own, I
created this website. Sam's corner is my own corner of the Internet, free from bloated scripting, AI-generated content and algorithms.  

### About me ###
I´m Samuel, 20-something old man from Sweden, suffering from chronic special interest addiction, a fake diagnose causing me to constantly gain and lose interest in new things, often centered around technology and vehicles. 


### How this website was made ###
This website is made with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org).

[This blog](https://mogwai.be/creating-a-simple.css-site-with-hugo/) was extremely helpful to get me started. I highly recommend it if
you want to create a static website and don´t know anything about web development(like me)!
